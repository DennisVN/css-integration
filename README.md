## css-integration (Part 1)
This site is about applying basic HTML and CSS skill in order to recreate given examples. This without the use of frameworks such as Tailwind or Bootstrap. SASS was allowed however ! 

## Motivation
This project exists as a part in my BeCode Jr WebDev path. This exercise is only the beginnning, as we started out with the front-end side, such as HTML SASS CSS and Bootstrap. 

## Code style
All code used was basic HMTL and CSS. Main styling done with the flex and float methods.
